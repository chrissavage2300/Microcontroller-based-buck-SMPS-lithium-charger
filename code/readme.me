In Constant current mode the PIC adjusts the duty such that the voltage is constant across the current sense resistors. The ratio is a little bit more than whats needed, ie 500mA is around 530 but 500mA is what is measured.

In Voltage mode its pretty much the same thing, the PIC adjusts the duty cycle such that it is constant across the feedback resistors.
